# Jobs-ETL
ETL project with scraped data from job portals with Beautiful Soup (Python) conducted by Yves Maillard, Lukas Niederh√§user and Daniel Podolecki 

The task is to scrape three different job portals. These are jobscout24.ch, indeed.ch and jobagent.ch. However in this github repository only the ETL part for jobagent.ch will be presented and how the merge is working. The goal of the work is to get an overview of the job market situation for data scientists.

You can watch the 7 mins video below to get a rough summary about the code.
