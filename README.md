# Jobs-ETL
ETL project with scraped data from job portals (jobscout24.ch, indeed.ch and jobagent.ch) with Beautiful Soup (Python) conducted by Yves Maillard, Lukas Niederh√§user and Daniel Podolecki.
The goal of the work is to get an overview of the job market situation for data scientists.

In this github repository only the ETL part for jobagent.ch will be presented (from Daniel Podolecki).

You can watch the 7 mins video below to get a rough summary about the code.
